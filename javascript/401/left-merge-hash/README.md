# Hashtables

A hash table is a data structure that is used to store keys and values. The keys are used to access the values in the hash table, and the values are stored in an array. The keys are used to calculate the index at which the value should be stored in the array using a hash function. The hash function is designed to minimize the number of collisions, which occur when two or more keys hash to the same index in the array.
