### Feature 1

In this case, your problem domain would be to implement a merge sort algorithm that can sort an array of elements in ascending order. The algorithm should be able to handle arrays of numbers as well as arrays of strings, and should preserve the relative order of elements with equal values. The algorithm should also be able to handle empty input arrays and should return an empty array in this case.
